# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

## Overview
The Rock, Paper, Scissors game is a classic hand game that is often played between two people. In this implementation, we bring the game to the web, allowing users to play against a computer opponent. This project is a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rock-paper-scissors-game-pTgwgvgH), designed to enhance front-end development skills.

## Features
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Users can select their choice (rock, paper, or scissors) and compete against a computer-generated choice.
- **Responsive Design**: The game is designed to be fully responsive, providing an optimal experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Animated Results**: Visual feedback is provided through animations that enhance the user experience.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For the structure of the game.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout, including responsive design techniques.
- **JavaScript**: For game logic and interactivity.
